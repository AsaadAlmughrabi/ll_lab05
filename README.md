# Singly Linked List

This project implements a singly linked list data structure in Python.

## Overview

A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element in the list is a separate object called a node. Each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

## Implementation

The project consists of two main components:

### Node Class

The `Node` class represents a node in the linked list. Each node has a value and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

### LinkedList Class

The `LinkedList` class represents the singly linked list data structure. It provides methods for appending nodes, deleting nodes, and accessing nodes by index. The class also implements the `__len__`, `__str__`, and `__getitem__` methods for convenience.

### Testing
The project includes test cases to ensure the correctness of the LinkedList class methods. You can run the tests using pytest:
``
pytest test_s_Linken_List.py
``
